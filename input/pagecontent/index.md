The Patient Demographics for Mobile (PDQm) Profile provides a transaction for mobile and lightweight browser-based applications to query a patient demographics supplier for a list of patients based on user-defined search criteria and retrieve a patientâ€™s demographic information. This profile provides a lightweight alternative to PDQ Patient Demographics Query [ITI-21] or PDQV3 Patient Demographics Query V3 [ITI-47].
