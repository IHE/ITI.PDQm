### Conformance Expectations

IHE uses the normative words: "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" according to [standards conventions](https://profiles.ihe.net/GeneralIntro/ch-E.html).

PDQm uses ```Must Support``` in StructureDefinition profiles. This is equivalent to the IHE use of **R2** as defined in [Appendix Z](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.10-profiling-conventions-for-constraints-on-fhir).
