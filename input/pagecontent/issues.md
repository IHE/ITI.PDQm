### Closed Issues

* Upgraded to FHIR R4
*	PDQm_100: Added the mothersMaidenName extended search parameter. Note that PDO Option does require sub normative extensions to support mothersMaidenName
*	Addressed CP-ITI-826 – PDQm Clarify requirements for Pediatric Demographics
  *	Pediatric Demographics Option – original PDQ indicated a last update date/time, and last updated facility element. These were identified as R2 elements. These are not part of the Patient Resource, but rather the Encounter resource. These elements are thus not in scope of PDQm.
