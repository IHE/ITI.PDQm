ITI.PDQm

This GITHUB repository is under development by ITI Technical committee.

The Patient Demographics for Mobile (PDQm) Profile provides a transaction for mobile and lightweight browser-based applications to query a patient demographics supplier for a list of patients based on user-defined search criteria and retrieve a patientâ€™s demographic information. This profile provides a lightweight alternative to PDQ Patient Demographics Query [ITI-21](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ITI-21.html) or PDQV3 Patient Demographics Query V3 [ITI-47](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ITI-47.html).

The IHE PDQm Profile text is Trial Use, this IG publication is Informative. After public comment resolution this Implementation Guide will become the Trial Use specification for PDQm.

This Continuous Build will appear https://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.PDQm/branches/main/index.html

After review, Formal Publication will be at https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/PDQm 

October 22, 2021 - ITI-Tech approved for Trial Implementation.
